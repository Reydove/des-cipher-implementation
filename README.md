 DES Cipher Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher in Python. The DES cipher is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. This implementation allows for both encryption and decryption of 64-bit blocks of text using a simplified DES process.

Introduction
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a widely used method of data encryption that utilizes a symmetric key for encrypting and decrypting data. This Python implementation demonstrates the fundamental concepts of DES, including initial and final permutations, expansion, substitution using S-boxes, and the Feistel structure.

Features
- Encrypt a 64-bit block of text.
- Decrypt a 64-bit block of text.
- Simple and easy-to-understand Python code.

 Requirements

- Python 3.12.5

Usage

Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mobolaji-habib/des-cipher-implementation.git
cd des_cipher_env

Running the Script
To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

For Encryption:
python des_cipher.py encrypt "Your 64-bit plain text here"



Running the Script
To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

For Encryption:

bash
Copy code
python des_cipher.py encrypt "Your 64-bit plain text here"

For Decryption:
python des_cipher.py decrypt "Your 64-bit cipher text here"

## Introduction
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a widely used method of data encryption that utilizes a symmetric key for encrypting and decrypting data. This Python implementation demonstrates the fundamental concepts of DES, including initial and final permutations, expansion, substitution using S-boxes, and the Feistel structure.

## Features
- Encrypt a 64-bit block of text.
- Decrypt a 64-bit block of text.
- Simple and easy-to-understand Python code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mobolaji-habib/des-cipher-implementation.git
cd des_cipher_env
Running the Script
To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

For Encryption:

bash
Copy code
python des_cipher.py encrypt "Your 64-bit plain text here"
For Decryption:

bash
Copy code
python des_cipher.py decrypt "Your 64-bit cipher text here"
Example
bash
Copy code
python des_cipher.py encrypt "ABCDEFGH"
python des_cipher.py decrypt "1010101010101010..."

How It Works

-Initial Permutation (IP): The input 64-bit block is permuted according to the IP table.
-Feistel Rounds: The block is divided into two halves, and the right half is expanded, XORed with a subkey, substituted using S-boxes, permuted, and then XORed with the left half.
-Final Permutation (IP^-1): After 16 rounds, the halves are swapped and combined, followed by the inverse permutation to get the final cipher text.
